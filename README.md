# Universal Console Utils

This extension is built to ease inserting log (print) statements while coding.

## Demo

### Demo with Selected Text

### Demo Blank Mode

## Usage

By default `Alt + Shift + L` (`Option + Shift + L` for Mac) key combination inserts the most common print statement of the language.

Also, if there is a selection in the editor, it inserts a print statement with that selection. It's like a shortcut for printing variables to the console.
